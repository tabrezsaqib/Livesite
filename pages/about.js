                . The Plants of New Brunswick will continue to grow and will
                take at least five years to complete. It will depict
                characteristics of each species that are important for
                identification, including flowers, leaves, fruits, and other
                anatomic features. It will also supply ecological information
                about each plant species identified. Descriptive terms for a
                non-scientific audience are used.

                The first year focused on the orchids and violets of New
                Brunswick. During the second year, additiional species in fern,
                woody, and non-woody families were added which expanded the
                selection criteria. The current selector structure is still a
                work in progress and refinements will be made during subsequent
                phases of the project. As the site development continues, other
                native and introduced plants found in New Brunswick will be
                added, along with mapping data and a French-language site.
