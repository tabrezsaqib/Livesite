                New Brunswick. The Plants of New Brunswick will continue to grow
                and will take at least five years to complete. It will depict

                identification, including flowers, leaves, fruits, and other
                anatomic features. It will also supply ecological information

                The focus of the first year has been creating backend
                infrastructure and adding data and images for violets and most
                of the orchid species. As the site development continues, other
                native and introduced plants found in New Brunswick will be
                added, along with mapping data and a French-language site.
